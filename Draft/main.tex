This master's thesis would not be possible without the support and guidance of my external supervisor Prof. James Farre. The research problem addressed in this thesis was initially proposed by Prof. Farre, whose expertise laid the foundation for this investigation. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Prof. Farre for the long mathematical discussions, for the practical and insightful advice, for motivating me at crucial moments, and for introducing me to the Moroccan restaurant. Suggestions made by Prof. Farre also helped remove inaccuracies and improve the clarity of this thesis.\\

I am deeply grateful to my local supervisor Prof. Pranab Sardar for sharing his expertise and providing thoughtful suggestions that improved the clarity and coherence of this thesis.\\

I would also like to thank Fabi, Martin, Jiajun, and Farhan for insightful discussions.\\

I am also grateful to DAAD-WISE scholarship and MPI-MIS for providing the financial funds to make it possible to visit and work in MPI-MIS. I would also like to thank them for helping me with the visa process.\\

I owe a deep debt of gratitude to Sanjana and my family, whose unrelenting support and faith in my abilities helped me navigate the most difficult moments of my thesis. Your presence in my life has made all the difference.

    \textbf{\Large Abstract}
\end{center}

Thurston's introduction of the asymmetric metric on Teichmuller space brought new interest to the hyperbolic geometric perspective to Teichmuller theory, which earlier was viewed in terms of complex analysis. In this dissertation, I go over several well known results in hyperbolic geometry and Teichmuller theory. Some theorems in Thurston's seminal paper \cite{thurston} are proved in this dissertation in detail using the proof ideas presented by Thurston. In the last chapter of this dissertation, the dilation ray construction in \cite{farre} is shown to be a Thurston geodesic for the case when the geodesic lamination is a pants decomposition.
